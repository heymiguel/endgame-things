SPOILERS BE HERE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
```

I finished watching Avengers Endgame watch a few days ago. My father - someone who isn't very spontaneous - asked me if he should watch it. "Yes," i answered over the instant messenger. He then asked me "How was it?" "Like saying goodbye to an old friend," I typed. I didn't mean to be cold, terse, or blunt. I meant what I said when it felt like saying goodbye; the words to describe what I was feeling in the seconds and minutes after I finished the bladder-marathon that is Avengers: Endgame simply were not available. 

## A Spiritual Experience

The ticketing system here in Toronto collapsed under the weight of everyone hitting `F5` repeatedly when ticket sales went live. So, i prayed to the Marvel gods, whispering my silent request to get tickets every time I refreshed the Cineplex webpage. THis first part of my pilgrimage took *3.5 hours* of prayer. At minute 215, with my credit card still warm from the speed at which i had to complete the online transaction (else lose my 5 minute grace period online hold), I started thinking about what other preparation I needed to complete.

Before one undergoes a spiritual dialogue, most world religions recommend some sort of _cleansing of the soul_ or similar preparation; an emptying of self and an abstinence from worldly things. Knowing that there would be some on the internet that would be less tactful and polite (read: _assholes_ and _trolls_), the first piece of my ritual abstinence would be to mute the internet in the days between opening day and saturday. The second piece would involve individuals in my place of work that may discuss this in vague and "non-contextual spoiler" terms - so I had to add that to the things I would cut out of my life, at least temporarily.

```
Avengers Fasting:
- no reddit
- no facebook
- no twitter
- no talking to people in the office unless it was purely work
- no staying in work conversations that even remotely resembled comic book talk
- no youtube (notably, people were uploading leaked fancams of the final fight and 
of **that Mjolnir** scene), since the thumbnails were spoilers
```

```
Four days of that would lead to a final day of additional fasting:
- No radio in the car heading to the cinema
- noise cancelling headphones playing loud music while on the subway
- head down while walking to the cinema. (Because there's some people who put spoilers on signs.)
```

I quit the internet (which we all know is the real first level of Maslow's hierarchy of needs) for the better part of a week, and gave up hearing and some vision on the Saturday. Thankfully, my wife was a recent convert to the MCU (i'm working on it) and assisted me to the cinema. We sat together and I whispered a few more choice words to the Marvel gods.

My hands were clammy and I noted an elevated heart rate as I watched the last of the forgettable commercials and trailers fade to black. 

## Unpacking My Thoughts
#### Did I like it?

If this is the first Marvel movie you're seeing, it's a hot mess. Nothing will make sense. A great exercise to do on the rewatch is imagine if _this_ is the first MCU movie you're seeing.  To quote my wife (who has seen some MCU movies beforehand), "Just imagine, if you never saw any of this before! *A VAN SPIT OUT A MAN!" *

If you come into this knowing some of these characters took 11 years to develop? _It's a lot better._

If you're coming into this expecting _GRATUITOUS_ amounts of fanservice? _15/10 would Avengers: Endgame again._

#### Why was Thanos so good in a fight? 

There's a lot of discussion about how good Thanos was against the Big Three, and against everyone in particular. I think there's a reason why Thor and Tony got somewhere but never _ultimately_ could beat him, even together. It's the same reason that the Hulk couldnt beat Thanos (and if you watch infinity war again you'll see). Thor and Tony have used  _raw power_ to overwhelm their opponents. 

In the case of Tony he defaults to this if there's no prep time. He beat Iron Monger because he had previous knowledge of the armor's weakness. He and Rhodey beat Vanko by essentially shooting kamehamehas at each other. He threw all his big suits at Killan. He used the Bleeding edge armor to create a massive repulsor beam to shoot Supergiant. Even with Iron Man round 1 vs Thanos it was dump everything into beams and hope for the best. (With prep time, the Batman argument holds - Tony can outsmart the best of em.) 

In the case of Thor this is even more obvious. Thor's been a heavy hitter and that's his go to move. Lightning blasts abound.

Thanos knows how to fight. He's either a warrior born into it and trained or... he had to learn to defeat everyone (the black order comes to mind) to get them to submit . If you look at his close up game with Hulk (in IW), there's weaving and body shots there. 

Tony and Thor teamed up to shoot Thanos in that cool scene (a homage to their first fight where Thor supercharged Tony), dumping even more power. Thanos did what you do if struck with a heavy blow - you parry, deflect, and dodge. Then he dismantled them with technique. 

This is why Mjolnir-Cap was so much more successful (to a point). The *power of Thor coupled with the technique* of the world's greatest soldier. It's not just overwhelmingly powerful energy - it's the same energy focused to do specific things, like disarm, disorient, and knock Thanos off balance. In the end, it became about pure strength and endurance, both of which Thanos had in spades. 

Sidebar: Mjolnir-Cap was a big moment for a lot of people. Not so much for me, however --- (and you can ask my wife) I squealed like an excited puppy when Thor dual-wielded Stormbreaker and Mjolnir. 


## Tidbits that were fun

#### rescue
I really enjoyed that Pepper got her own suit of armor. It's a reference to when she was given the Rescue armor in the comics (This was Matt Fraction's _BRILLIANT_ Iron Man run).

On a less hype note, I think that the women in Endgame were not given any sort of proper setup or plot application; in many ways they were just window dressing (especially that scene in the final fight which really felt forced), and I was quite disappointed ; a notable example is Evangeline Lily -  having her essentially as Ant-Man's exclamation point really backslid any sort of traction and momentum that previous movies created for her. 

#### stormbreaker's relaxed requirements
There was an interivew with the Russos that mentioned Stormbreaker not having the same "requirements" as Mjolnir; this is probably how Thanos was able to press the weapon up against the Son of Odin. In IW, Stormbreaker is called a "Kingly Weapon," which may give some clue as to Thanos' status or place amongst the individuals in the MCU. Thanos also can wield infinity stones with relative ease, something that took a half-celestial to do right in Guardians of the galaxy. 


#### Danver's haircut
People be shittin' on Carol's haircut. 
My A++ defense: (this is just an opinion of one) Short hair === hot. 

#### Hail Hydra
This is subversion done right. They even got the shot where Crossbones is going for his baton/ sidearm. 

#### Casually Solving time travel
Tony Stark solved time travel by spending an extra couple of hours in his garage. How much have you accomplished this year? 

#### "on your left!"
This, by far was my favourite bit of fanservice. Mostly because it follows a _desktop wallpaper worthy_ scene where bruised and beat-up Cap was getting ready to face Thanos' army alone. It also foreshadow's Sam's new role as Captain America, as he was first on the scene and presumably the one with the plan before handing it off to Rogers. 

## Closing Story Arcs

#### Done Poorly
_Black Widow and Hawkeye_
Honestly, BW got the shaft in terms of a story arc. Marvel just didn't know what to do with her, from potential love interest to finder of lost teammates to dealing with depression / PTSD, and finally "to finding her purpose with a final sacrifice." Besides, I think Natasha and Clint both got screwed, and could have gotten away with a bit of Infinity Stone Lawyering (more on this later.)

_Hawkeye er *cough* Ronin._
I get that he lost everyone and became an enraged killer of bad people - but I feel they turned him into Ronin only to get him into the Rule of Cool. I think spearing people from a distance with arrows would have been just as deadly and even more impactful, considering bow usage was foreshadowed early in the movie. Like Ponci said: "He could have done all of that as Hawkeye." 

```
Infinity Stone Lawyering

To get the soul stone you have to lose something you truly love. 
I would have loved to see Hawkeye walk up to Red Skull, scream at him, shoot arrows, or slash him or whatever saying -
"I HAVE ALREADY LOST EVERYTHING" (i'm bad at dialogue.) 

Clint lost thrice. 

He's overqualified to get the damn Soul Stone. 

(this way you get to keep BW alive and resolve her family arc by being with the Avengers as they attend Tony's funeral) 

But what do I know, right? :P

```


#### Done Well
_Captain America_

I was 100% sure that Cap would die. When I saw him stand up vs Thanos's army - I *KNEW* that was going to be it. As "the man out of time,"  I had always thought the end of his arc would be to join Peggy in the next life. Personally I was happy to be wrong and I think aged-Cap was a great way to sunset his arc and let someone else take the mantle. 

_Thor_

Ragnarok was the *beginning* of a right and proper character arc for the Son of Odin; in that he is still trying to find his place in the universe. I'm excited to see Asguardians of the Galaxy. 


#### Mixed feelings
_Iron Man._

Hoooo boy. My fave character and the source of this bias. (Been a fan of shellhead since the very first week Ponci got me into comics) 

Conveniently, we forget that any number of the sorcerers could sling ring the slight-of-handed gauntlet out of Tony's hands, and unto Hulk's good arm. This also sets up the "Hulk vs Thanos" rematch that everyone was begging for, by letting Banner outhink Thanos, saving Tony! Yay!

I know, I know. "You can rest now," Pepper says - which is the real end of his arc to protect the world from everything. I just don't like it when my fave characters _have_ to die. (I'm looking at you, Maximus. (from Gladiator) You should have lived.) 


## Conclusion / TLDR;

To quote Aaron Palabyab (who agreed to be quoted in this piece): "Was wistful half my lifetime ago that I wouldn’t have a movie experience like Return of the King (and LOTR) again." I have the same feeling, A.

As a culmination of 11 years of ups and downs, as a set of movies that i _literally_ grew up with and as a love letter to all the movies previous, Endgame delivers that RoTK feeling - a feeling I thought I would never experience in the cinemas again; a vast, powrful welling up of your inner nerd - checked only briefly by the social norms of "don't be noisy at the theatre." A movie that's filled with the quotes and moments that I so love to memorize and commit to memory.

I left that theatre feeling mostly happy - the only sadness was
